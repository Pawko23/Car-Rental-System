# Rental Car System

This Java project implements a simple rental car system where users can view available cars, rent them, and return them. It's designed with a graphical user interface using Swing.

# Features

* Car Selection: Users can view a list of available cars, including their brand, model, power, year, price per day and availability status.
* Renting: Users can rent a car by specifying the number of days they want to rent it for, provided they have enough funds in their wallet.
* Returning: Users can return a rented car, which updates its availability status and allows it to be rented by another user.
* Wallet Management: Users have a wallet where they can add funds and check their balance.
